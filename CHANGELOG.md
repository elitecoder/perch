# Changelog

## 0.1.9 (2026-05-09)

### Fixes

- **Thread `unwatch` didn't stop the watch** — typing `unwatch` inside a watch thread appeared to do nothing: Claude kept posting, and the confirmation either never appeared or showed up at the channel root. Bolt's `say()` helper only carries `{token, text, channel}` — it drops `thread_ts` even when the triggering message was a thread reply — so `say({ text: ':white_check_mark: Stopped watching …' })` posted to channel root instead of in the thread. The thread branch of `handleText` now uses `poster.postToThread(threadTs, …)` for both the `keys`/`help` listing and the `unwatch` confirmation, and also clears `watchThreads[paneId]` so a daemon restart can't re-resume into a ghost thread. Added a unit regression in `socket.test.ts` that asserts `say()` is never called on thread replies and that `chat.postMessage` is dispatched with the correct `thread_ts` — a mutation probe (reverting to `say({text})`) was verified to make the test fail.

## 0.1.8 (2026-04-26)

### Features

- **Watch bootstrap summary** — attaching to an already-running Claude session used to leave the Slack thread empty until Claude's next activity, so viewers had no context. `watch` now reads the tail of the JSONL and posts a one-line `*Last prompt:*` / `*Last response:*` summary to the thread before entering live-tail. Best-effort: a missing or unreadable file posts nothing, as before.

### Fixes

- **Watch threads showing another session's content** — when two panes ran Claude inside the same repo (same `cwd`, different cmux workspaces), both watch threads received updates from whichever sibling had written most recently, because the resolver picked "the freshest JSONL in the project directory" for every Claude process sharing that directory. The state hook now records `pid → current sessionId` as a side-effect of every hook invocation, and the resolver consults that map first (falling back to argv `--session-id`, then to the old freshest-in-dir heuristic). That's ground-truth: the hook is invoked by the Claude process itself with its live session ID, even across Claude's internal rotations. Existing hook installs are updated by `perch setup`; the running daemon picks up the new mapping as each Claude fires its next hook event (activity-based — idle sessions are unaffected until they next do something).

- **`list` command shows workspace name only** — the Slack `list` response labeled every Claude session with its cmux workspace name, which made two panes in the same workspace indistinguishable and hid the current task. `list` now renders `*Workspace — Surface title*` when the two differ (falling back to workspace-only when they match or when the adapter doesn't expose a pane title). The cmux adapter already parses the surface title from `list-panels`; it's now propagated through `Pane.title` → `ClaudePane.paneTitle` → the list renderer.

## 0.1.7 (2026-04-15)

### Fixes

- **cmux 0.63 API compatibility** — the daemon crashed with `not_found: Workspace not found` whenever a watched pane lived outside the user's currently focused cmux workspace. cmux 0.63 stopped resolving bare surface refs against any workspace; `capture-pane`, `send`, and `send-key` now pass `--workspace` alongside `--surface` so cross-workspace operations work again.
- **cmux `new-split` output parsing** — cmux 0.63 wraps the new ref as `OK surface:N workspace:M` instead of emitting a bare `surface:N`; `splitPane` now extracts the surface ref from either form.
- **cmux `selectPane`** — cmux 0.63 removed the `focus-surface` subcommand; switched to the `surface.focus` RPC method (which is still supported).

## 0.1.6 (2026-04-09)

### Fixes

- **Node 25.5.0 startup crash** — `import { App } from '@slack/bolt'` failed on Node 25.5.0 with `SyntaxError: Named export 'App' not found` because that release's bundled `cjs-module-lexer` didn't detect bolt's CJS named exports. Switched to default-import + destructure, which is version-agnostic.

## 0.1.5 (2026-04-06)

### Features

- **Interactive prompt buttons** — Claude Code `AskUserQuestion`, `ExitPlanMode`, and permission prompts now show interactive choice/approval buttons in Slack threads
- **Per-user Slack apps** — each user creates their own Slack app named `Perch-<username>` instead of sharing one
- **Improved setup flow** — clearer Slack app install instructions, channel ID guidance, bot invite reminders, and auto-restart of cmux after enabling Automation Mode
- **Auto permission mode** — `new` command launches Claude Code with `--permission-mode auto`
- **Channel isolation** — daemon only responds in the configured Slack channel, ignoring messages elsewhere

### Fixes

- **False "needs attention" buttons** — stale marker files in `waiting/` and `interactive/` dirs are now cleaned up when new JSONL records arrive and auto-pruned after 60 seconds
- **Buffered view text lost** — `flush()` is now called at the end of each tick so short status updates aren't dropped
- **Response state not resetting** — user records consisting entirely of system-injected XML tags no longer leave the response state stuck
- **System tag leakage** — `<system-reminder>` and similar tags injected by Claude Code are stripped from user records before posting to Slack
- **Node 20-22/25+ compatibility** — reverted CJS interop hacks that broke on Node 24; restricted engine to supported versions

### Changes

- **Remove `assistant:write` scope** — removed assistant view and typing status scope from Slack manifest (not required for core functionality)
- **Remove shared app setup** — simplified to single-user app creation flow
- **Unit test coverage expansion** — added tests for session manager, screen-parser utils, claude-finder, socket handler, and error paths across all adapters and poster (+81 tests, 240 → 322)

## 0.1.4 (2026-04-06)

### Features

- **Claude Code prerequisite check** — setup now verifies Claude Code is installed before proceeding, with install instructions if missing
- **cmux install offer** — when no multiplexer is detected, setup offers to install cmux via `brew install --cask cmux`
- **Auto-enable Automation Mode** — setup reads cmux's `socketControlMode` preference and offers to enable it via `defaults write` instead of requiring manual UI navigation
- **cmux skill for Claude Code** — when cmux is selected, setup installs a comprehensive cmux CLI skill to `~/.claude/skills/cmux/` so Claude Code sessions have native awareness of all cmux commands (terminal I/O, workspaces, splits, browser automation, sidebar metadata, notifications)
- **Skill cleanup on uninstall** — `perch uninstall` removes installed Claude Code skills

### Fixes

- **Setup manifest path** — read canonical `slack/manifest.json` instead of hardcoded copy

## 0.1.3 (2026-04-06)

### Features

- **Approval buttons** — permission requests now show interactive Accept/Reject buttons in Slack instead of text-only prompts, with hook-based approvals for plan mode
- **Emoji status reactions** — parent watch messages show live emoji indicators (wrench, speech balloon, thinking, hourglass, checkmark) reflecting Claude's current state
- **Typing indicator** — Slack assistant typing status ("is thinking...") with automatic lease renewal
- **Stall detection** — hourglass at 10s and warning at 30s of inactivity, with debounced intermediate states
- **State hooks** — new `state-hook.sh` and PreToolUse/Stop/UserPromptSubmit/Notification Claude Code hooks feed real-time state events to the daemon
- **New thread command** — `new thread` in a watch thread starts a fresh thread and links back to the old one
- **Slash command forwarding** — `!clear` or `.clear` in a watch thread sends `/clear` to Claude
- **Smart text splitting** — content chunking now preserves code fence boundaries across Slack messages
- **Slack mrkdwn escaping** — `toSlackMrkdwn` now properly escapes `&`, `<`, `>` in plain text while preserving code blocks and inline code
- **Tool call deduplication** — consecutive identical tool calls are collapsed with a repeat count (e.g., `Read a.ts (x3)`)

### Changes

- **Remove LiveView / scraping watch** — all monitoring now uses transcript-based `ConversationalView`; removed `LiveView` class, `StateMachine` ticking, and `watch()` method from `WatcherManager`
- **Two-tier throttling** — status edits throttled at 1.5s, response edits at 300ms with 40-char buffer threshold; `flush()` drains pending edits
- **Higher edit limit** — `chat.update` now uses 4000-char limit (vs 3000 for `postMessage`)
- **Extract resume logic** — watch resume moved to `resume.ts` module
- **Separate read/write Slack clients** — poster now takes a dedicated read client with conservative retry config
- **New Slack scopes** — added `assistant:write`, `reactions:read`, `reactions:write`; updated manifest with assistant view and `assistant_thread_started` event
- **E2E CI job** — added self-hosted E2E runner to CI workflow

## 0.1.2 (2026-04-05)

### Features

- **Watch thread persistence** — daemon restarts now silently resume posting to the same Slack thread instead of creating a new one
- **Watch confirmation in thread** — "Started watching" message now posts inside the watch thread instead of the main channel

### Fixes

- **False Claude session listings** — `list` no longer shows non-Claude panes that happen to share a CWD with a recent Claude session
- **Short IDs everywhere** — all Slack-facing pane references now use short IDs consistently

## 0.1.1 (2026-04-05)

### Features

- **Transcript monitoring** — new transcript system reads Claude Code JSONL session files, detects tool calls, end-of-turn events, and formats them as Slack status updates and responses
- **Ask command** — interactive Claude Code sessions managed via Slack threads with session lifecycle tracking
- **Claude Code hooks** — `perch setup` now installs hooks into Claude Code settings for session-start, stop, and notification events
- **Claude pane finder** — auto-discovers active Claude Code sessions by scanning for `.claude` JSONL transcript files

### Fixes

- **Add `files:read` Slack bot scope** — image and file attachments sent through Slack now download correctly instead of silently saving HTML error pages
- **Validate file download content-type** — Slack file downloads now check for HTML responses and log a clear error when the bot lacks `files:read` scope
- **cmux sendText split** — send text and Enter as separate commands for better TUI compatibility (fixes input issues with Claude Code)

### Changes

- **Short IDs in `list`** — `list` command now shows compact short IDs (e.g. `5`) instead of full pane IDs
- **Remove generic plugin** — removed unused `generic` preset plugin
- **Remove Zellij support** — removed Zellij E2E tests and references (no adapter implemented)
- **Key alias updates** — `accept` now sends Enter, `reject` sends Escape
- **E2E test improvements** — added cmux Claude session E2E test, replaced shell-command forwarding tests with prompt forwarding, added dedicated vitest E2E config
- **README rewrite** — updated to reflect transcript-powered workflow, Claude-only focus, current command set

## 0.1.0 (2026-04-04)

First public release.

### Features

- **Terminal control via Slack** — list sessions, read pane output, send text and keystrokes from any Slack channel
- **Live watch** — monitor a pane with updates edited in place (single message, no flood)
- **Short pane IDs** — type bare numbers like `5` instead of full IDs like `cmux:workspace:1:surface:5`; `list` shows the short form
- **Preset plugins** — `claude` preset tracks Claude Code states (thinking, waiting, idle, error) with smart transition detection; `generic` preset works with any terminal process
- **Key aliases in watch threads** — type `accept`, `reject`, `esc`, `ctrl-c`, `up`, `down`, `tab`, etc. in a watch thread to send keys to the pane
- **Thread replies forwarded** — replies in a watch thread are sent directly to the pane as text or key aliases
- **Global default preset** — auto-saved on first watch, applied to all future panes; override per-pane with `preset <pane> <plugin-id>`
- **Watch persistence** — watches resume automatically after `perch restart`
- **Re-watch** — watching an already-watched pane starts a fresh thread (no error, no hunting for the old one)
- **Workspace management** — create/close sessions, split panes, rename, select
- **Setup wizard** — interactive `perch setup` walks through multiplexer detection, Slack app creation, token validation, channel config, and LaunchAgent installation
- **Existing config defaults** — re-running setup preserves your channel ID and tokens
- **curl installer** — single command install, auto-restarts daemon if already running
- **Clean uninstall** — `perch uninstall` removes `~/.perch`, LaunchAgent, and the global binary
